# Spam-Classifier

## Project Overview

This project implements a Spam Classifier designed to accurately identify and filter out unwanted spam messages, whether they are SMS messages or emails. The goal is to provide a robust solution for distinguishing legitimate communications from spam, thereby improving user experience and security.

## Features


* **High Accuracy:** Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to achieve high precision in spam detection.
* **Real-time Classification:** Capable of classifying messages in real-time.
* **User-friendly Interface:** (If applicable, describe any UI)
* **Scalable:** Designed to handle a large volume of messages efficiently.
* **Customizable:** Allows for easy integration and customization for different datasets or message types.

## Technologies Used


* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK (for natural language processing)
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Web Framework:** (e.g., Flask, Django, if it's a web application)
* **Other Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites


* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)
* Specific libraries: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk` (adjust as per your project)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mukulJangid-git/Spam-Classifier.git](https://github.com/mukulJangid-git/Spam-Classifier.git)
    cd Spam-Classifier
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If you have a `requirements.txt` file, otherwise list individual `pip install` commands as above)*

### Usage

*(Provide clear instructions on how to run and use your spam classifier. Examples:)*

* **Training the Model:**
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
    *(Or specify the Jupyter Notebook to run: `jupyter notebook your_notebook_name.ipynb`)*

* **Classifying a new message:**
    ```python
    # Example Python code snippet
    from your_module import SpamClassifier

    classifier = SpamClassifier()
    # Load your trained model if necessary
    # classifier.load_model('path/to/your/model.pkl')

    message = "Congratulations! You've won a free iPhone. Click here."
    result = classifier.predict(message)

    if result == 'spam':
        print("This message is spam.")
    else:
        print("This message is not spam.")
    ```
